Footnotes:
1,"The base population for these projections is derived from the official preliminary postcensal estimates of the population for Canada, provinces and territories as of July 1, 2024. In all scenarios, the population is projected until 2049 for the provinces and territories, and until 2074 for Canada as a whole. For a summary of short and long-term projection scenario assumptions, see <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/91-520-x/91-520-x2025001-eng.htm" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Population Projections for Canada (2024 to 2074), Provinces and Territories (2024 to 2049) (opens new window)</a>. Because of rounding, counts within tables may differ from the totals."
2,"The population is projected until 2049 for the provinces and territories, and until 2074 for Canada as a whole."
3,"The demographic projections now incorporate the concept of gender, which was first introduced in the 2021 Census of Population. Gender refers to an individual's personal and social identity as a man, woman or non-binary person (a person who is not exclusively a man or a woman). Demographic projections are available for the gender category "Men+", which includes men (and/or boys), as well as some non-binary persons, and for the gender category “Women+" category, which includes women (and/or girls), as well as some non-binary persons."
