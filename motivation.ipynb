    "Excellent — you’re asking *the* right question at exactly the right time. ❤️\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s talk honestly about this:\n",
    "Yes — **your project *can absolutely* be portfolio-ready**, *if* you frame and present it the right way.\n",
    "But to make it *stand out*, you’ll want to highlight **what it reveals** and **how it connects to real-world issues**, not just the data cleaning or modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break it down carefully 👇\n",

    "## 🧩 1️⃣ Why this project *already* has strong portfolio value\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Real-world relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re tackling one of the most discussed economic issues in Canada — the housing crisis.\n",
    "That’s instantly relatable to any recruiter or reviewer, whether they’re in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data science 💻\n",
    "* Economics 🏦\n",
    "* Policy / urban planning 🏙️\n",
    "* Or private-sector analytics (e.g. banking, real estate, ESG)\n",

    "* Merged multi-source macroeconomic data (StatCan + CMHC)\n",
    "* Created **derived features** (Δpopulation, HAI) from real definitions\n",
    "* Handled **time-series**, **resampling**, **lag features**, **rolling forecasts**\n",
    "* Dealt with **missing data**, **scaling**, and **interpretability**\n",
    "\n",
    "→ That’s exactly the mix of skills employers look for — data wrangling, reasoning, and model validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Interpretability and storytelling\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re not just predicting a number — you’re quantifying **supply–demand adequacy** in housing, something policymakers care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "→ That gives your project **a story arc**, not just “I trained a model.”\n",
    "You can literally say:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “I built a model to forecast whether housing supply will keep up with population growth — a quantitative way to track the housing crisis.”\n",

    "\n",
    "Later, you can easily expand with one new variable (e.g., interest rate, building permits) to show you understand external drivers.\n",
    "Or wrap it into a small dashboard (Plotly, Streamlit) that visualizes adequacy trends.\n",
