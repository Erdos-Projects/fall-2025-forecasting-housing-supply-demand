    "\n",
    "## **Project Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "Canada is experiencing rapid population growth, driven largely by immigration, while housing affordability and availability have become national concerns. A key question is whether new housing construction (housing starts) is keeping pace with the demand created by rising populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Goal**\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a forecasting framework that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Measures housing adequacy** by comparing *needed housing starts* (based on population growth and average household size) with *actual housing starts*.\n",
    "2. **Forecasts future housing adequacy** at the provincial level, highlighting where shortages are likely to persist or worsen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **quarterly population estimates** (by province, 1990–2025) to compute population growth.\n",
    "* Use **household size estimates (2009–2024)** to translate population growth into **needed housing starts**.\n",
    "* Use **monthly housing starts data (1990–2025, CMHC)** to measure **actual supply** (aggregated to quarterly).\n",
    "* Develop a **rolling forecasting model** (time series or regression) to predict future housing adequacy.\n",
    "* Evaluate model accuracy using historical out-of-sample tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Metrics / KPIs**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Housing Starts per 1,000 New Residents**\n",
    "   [\n",
    "   \\text{HSR} = \\frac{\\text{Actual Starts}}{\\Delta \\text{Population}/1000}\n",

    "2. **Housing Adequacy Index (HAI)**\n",
    "   [\n",
    "   HAI = \\frac{\\text{Actual Starts}}{\\text{Needed Starts}}\n",
    "   ]\n",
    "\n",
    "   * HAI < 1 → shortage; HAI > 1 → surplus\n",
    "3. **Forecast Accuracy Metrics** (RMSE, MAE, MAPE) for housing starts predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Stakeholders**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Policy Makers**: Federal (IRCC, CMHC), Provincial governments → to align immigration & housing policy\n",
    "* **Urban Planners & Municipalities**: To anticipate housing pressures locally\n",
    "* **Economists & Researchers**: Studying the drivers of the housing crisis\n",
    "* **Real Estate & Finance Sector**: Developers, banks, investors tracking housing demand\n",
    "* **Public & Media**: Citizens concerned about affordability and supply gaps\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Deliverables**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **forecasting model** predicting housing adequacy (2025–2030).\n",
    "* **Visualizations** showing historical and forecasted gaps between *needed* vs *actual* housing starts.\n",
    "* Provincial comparisons (Ontario vs Québec vs BC vs Alberta) to show regional disparities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ This way, your project is **policy-relevant, data-driven, and novel**: you’re not just predicting population or housing separately, but **forecasting the adequacy gap** — a metric that directly addresses the housing crisis narrative.\n",

    "  “Given population trends we already observe, are housing starts keeping up?”\n",
    "* Once you’ve validated that framework, you can add projected population growth for scenario forecasting (e.g. “What if immigration remains at 2023 levels?”).\n",

    "\n",
    "Canada is experiencing an unprecedented housing shortage driven by rapid population growth, record immigration, and limited construction capacity. To understand whether new housing supply is keeping pace with demographic pressure, this project builds and forecasts a Housing Adequacy Index (HAI) — the ratio of housing starts to population-driven housing needs. Using provincial-level data on population and housing starts from 1990–2025, the analysis evaluates how housing adequacy has evolved and whether the imbalance is likely to worsen or improve in the near future.\n",
    "By modeling housing starts and deriving predicted HAI, the project provides a quantitative early-warning indicator of future housing stress. A declining HAI signals that new construction is failing to match the needs of a growing population, even before prices or rents react. This approach helps policymakers, planners, and researchers gauge the structural adequacy of Canada’s housing supply and anticipate where shortages may intensify if current trends continue."
