    "📄 Feature Engineering Summary (for same-quarter forecast)\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore whether adding more temporal context could improve forecasting accuracy, I experimented with extended lag features (lag8), smoothed rolling means (starts_ma4_lag4), and quarter dummy variables (q_2–q_4).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these additions did not improve model performance—in several provinces, error metrics (MAE, RMSE, MASE) actually increased.\n",
    "This likely reflects overfitting and multicollinearity among highly correlated lag and rolling features, combined with the relatively small sample size per province (~130 quarters).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, I reverted to the simpler, horizon-safe feature set (lag4 + key exogenous factors), which produced more stable and interpretable results.\n",
    "The test confirms that added model complexity is not always beneficial for smaller time series with strong seasonal structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 This sounds deliberate and thoughtful rather than like a “mistake.”\n",
    "So yes — revert to your earlier simpler setup for results, but keep the experiment mentioned in your write-up as part of your model comparison narrative."

    "We tested adding higher-order lags (2–3 quarters), quarter-of-year dummy variables, and a short-term momentum term.\n",
    "However, these did not significantly improve predictive accuracy. In several provinces, errors even increased slightly, likely because the additional features introduced collinearity and noise rather than new information."
