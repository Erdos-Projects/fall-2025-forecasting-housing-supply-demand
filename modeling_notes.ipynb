    "### 🧩 1. The idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Many economic indicators (like housing starts) **repeat seasonally** — e.g., construction is high every spring/summer, low in winter.\n",
    "The seasonal-naïve model assumes:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “This quarter will be just like the same quarter last year.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, for a quarterly series ( y_t ):\n",
    "[\n",
    "\\hat{y}*{t+h} = y*{t+h-4}\n",
    "]\n",
    "because there are 4 quarters in a year.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Strong seasonal structure:** Captures the repeating annual cycle automatically.\n",
    "* **Hard to beat:** Even sophisticated ARIMA, ETS, or ML models may only improve a bit.\n",
